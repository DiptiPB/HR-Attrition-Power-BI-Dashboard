# HR-Attrition-Power-BI-Dashboard

## Overview 
This project covers setting up the dashboard layout, connecting data, creating DAX measures, and designing interactive visuals to track key HR metrics like attrition and headcount.

## Objectives
- Load data using Get Data and clean it in Power Query.
- Use slicers for fields like Gender, Department, and Job Role.
- Create KPI cards with DAX for total employees, attrition count, and attrition rate, Avg age and Avg monthly income.
- Use donut charts to show attrition by Gender.
- Use bar and column chart to show Education, Education Field, Job Role, and Age Group.
- Create age groups using a calculated column with SWITCH and sort using a helper column.
- Use a area chart to show attrition trend over time based on a Date field.
- Apply a custom background for layout; arrange visuals cleanly using alignment tools.
- Build DAX measures for dynamic calculations and improve interactivity with filters and slicers.
  
## Findings and Conclusion
- The overall attrition rate helps benchmark turnover and track changes over time.
- Higher attrition is commonly seen in younger age groups and certain job roles like Sales.
- Gender-based differences are minimal but may vary by department or role.
- Employees with specific education levels or fields (e.g., Life Sciences) show higher attrition, suggesting role fit issues.
- Custom age groups reveal clear trends and allow focused retention strategies.
- Time-based trends show seasonal spikes, useful for planning interventions.
- These findings support data-driven decision-making, enabling improved resource management and revenue optimization.

With these findings, organizations can proactively address turnover risks and enhance employee retention efforts.
